# agents.cs2
Porting every single agent model from CSGO (Until CS2 comes around) to GLB. The main focus is to serve the .ROUNDS project.

## Folder structure
  * /animations/ - Files within this folder will contain each celebrate_* (animset_uiplayer_endofmatch) animation separate by name. The GLB files will only contain animation info, nothing more.
  * /agents/     - Will contain every single agent found inside CSGO. Keep in mind that these files are compress for web usage. Keep in mind that some files might be bigger than others, there might also be agents that won't be found in this decom, we're waiting for CS2 to port each agent models (again) with the same compiled settings and animations.
