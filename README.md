# agents.cs2
Porting every single agent model from CSGO (Until CS2 comes around) to GLB. The main focus is to serve the .ROUNDS project.

## Folder structure
  * /animations/ - Files within this folder will contain each celebrate_* animation separate by name. The GLB files will only contain animation info, nothing more.
  * /agents/     - Will contain every single agent found inside CSGO. Keep in mind that these files are compress for web usage.
